    <h3 class="w3-text-light-grey">About</h3>
    <p>
      SquireBot is a Discord bot that helps people run tournaments (mostly for Magic: the Gathering) natively in Discord.
      It helps manage registration information, pairing, scoring, and other tournament logistics all from Discord.
      This centralization of tournament management inside Discord allows tournaments can be interfaced with on both mobile and desktop.
      This allows players to interact with the tournament from the table they are sit at, outside the venue, or digitally around the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name - SquireBot gets it name from its role in tournament organizing.
      It helps players get ready for "battle", much a squire does.

    <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Impetus</h3>
    <p>
      The primary goal of SquireBot is two-fold: offer Discord-native tournament management and highly customizable methods of running a tournament.
      Having Discord-intergrated tournament management allows for a single platform to be used for communicating tournament information as well as giving channels for communication between players that are playing against each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are near infinite methods of pairing people in a tournament, and people come up with new methods constantly.
      SquireBot provides a set of tools for customizing a tournament in a dynamic and flexible manner while allow easy setting for common tournament set-ups.

    <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">History</h3>
    <p>
    	I started writting SquireBot in Python in November of 2020 for an large online tournament planned for March.
			The initial plan for SquireBot was pretty small, allow players to join a looking-for-games queue and pair players against others they had yet to battle each other.
			Quickly, though, the scope of the project grew to the point where it was a one-stop-shop for organizing a tournament.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Logistically, there are lots of moving and interconnected parts in a tournament, tracking open/closed matches, players' scores, and registation information just to name a few.
    	Tournaments can be very chaotic for staff and organizers, so handling all of these under a single system is massively helpful.
    	Of course, there are other systems can handle most of these logistics, but all are web-based and none of them have a Discord intergration.
    	Moreover, there wasn't a system that could handle the kind of dynamic pairings we were looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original iteration of SquireBot used the <a href="">discord.py</a> library.
      After the <a href="">announcement</a> that the library would no longer be supported, I talked with some other devs, and we decided to break SquireBot in a front and back end and change languages.
      Just a year after the first commit of the project, the port to SquireCore and SquireBot started.
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Plans</h3>
    <p>
      SquireBot and SquireCore are still under construction.
      SquireCore will seperately manage tournament information while SquireBot will interface with Discord.
