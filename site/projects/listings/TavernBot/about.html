    <p>
      Aside from asking other players that you know if they have a card that you're looking for, there isn't a good service for facilating trades (in-person or remotely).
      TavernBot seeks to fill this gap by oftening three major services.
      People can manage a buylist, manage a sell list, and visually track a trade between each other.
