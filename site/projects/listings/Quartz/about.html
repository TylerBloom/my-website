    <h3 class="w3-text-light-grey">About</h3>
    <p>
      Quartz is a library for scientific computing for Rust.
      It includes a port of most of the major features of the Python library <a href="https://scipy.org/">SciPy</a>.
      There are also tools for infacing with other MtG-related things, such as deck websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name - "scientific" is often shorted to "sci" or "sy".
      If shortened to "si", you can substitute "Si" for "Fe" in Rust's chemical formula to "SiO_2", the primary component of Quartz.

    <p>
      Rust's features of memory and concurrency safty, lack of GC, and speeds similar to those of C/C++ make it an excellent canidate for the scientific computing space.
      Moveover, there are not very few language offer well-rounded libraries to aid with scientific computing.
      Python with its SciPy library in an exception to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      For people getting into computing for scientific projects, SciPy offers a fantastic user expirence in a language that is relately easy to learn.
      However, Python is not a great language for performance, which is vital for larger projects.
      Quartz's primary goal is to combine the wonderful features of Rust with the bevy of tools similar to what is available in SciPy to people in the scientific computing space.
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">History</h3>
    <p>
      Quartz is still being actively written.
    </p>
    <h3 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey">Plans</h3>
    <p>
      The SciPy port is still being actively worked on.
